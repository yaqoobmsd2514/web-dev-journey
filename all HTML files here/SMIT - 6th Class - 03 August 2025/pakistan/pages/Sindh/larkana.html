            Larkana is a prominent city in the Sindh province of Pakistan,
            located in the northwest of the province. It is known for its
            political history, educational institutions, and archaeological
            significance. Larkana is the hometown of former Prime Ministers
            Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto, making it a stronghold for
            the Pakistan People‚Äôs Party (PPP). The city is also located near the
            ancient site of Mohenjo-Daro, one of the most important cities of
            the Indus Valley Civilization. The main languages spoken here are
            Sindhi and Urdu. Larkana has a strong agricultural economy,
            producing crops such as rice, wheat, and sugarcane. The city is home
            to several colleges and hospitals, serving as a regional hub for
            education and healthcare. The people of Larkana are known for their
            hospitality and cultural pride. Traditional Sindhi clothing, music,
            and food are integral to daily life. The city has good road
            connectivity and continues to expand with new housing schemes and
            commercial projects. Despite facing issues such as water supply and
            urban planning, Larkana remains a city of historical and cultural
            importance in Pakistan.
