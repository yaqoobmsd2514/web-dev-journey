            Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan and the capital of the Sindh
            province. It is also the countryâ€™s main financial, industrial, and
            commercial center. With a population exceeding 20 million, Karachi
            is one of the worldâ€™s most populous cities. Located on the Arabian
            Sea, it serves as Pakistanâ€™s busiest seaport. The city is incredibly
            diverse, with people from all ethnic and linguistic backgrounds
            living and working together. Urdu is the main language, but Sindhi,
            Punjabi, Pashto, and others are also widely spoken. Karachi is home
            to numerous educational institutions, such as Karachi University and
            NED University. The city offers employment opportunities in sectors
            like banking, media, IT, and manufacturing. Places like Clifton
            Beach, Quaid-e-Azamâ€™s Mausoleum, and Port Grand are popular with
            tourists. Karachi also has a rich arts and fashion scene, along with
            a vibrant food culture. The cityâ€™s infrastructure has been under
            pressure due to rapid growth, but ongoing development projects aim
            to improve transport and utilities. Despite challenges, Karachi
            remains a symbol of Pakistanâ€™s economic ambition and multicultural
            harmony.
