            Dera Ismail Khan, commonly known as DI Khan, is a historic city
            located in the southern part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan.
            Situated near the Indus River, the city serves as a bridge between
            the KPK and Punjab provinces. It has a population of over 100,000
            people and is known for its cultural diversity, agricultural
            economy, and peaceful environment. The local language is primarily
            Saraiki, but Pashto and Urdu are also spoken widely. DI Khan is
            famous for its dates, mangoes, and sugarcane production. The region
            has a warm climate, and the fertile land supports farming throughout
            the year. Historically, the city has been a center of learning and
            spirituality, with several madrasas, shrines, and historic sites.
            Educational institutions like Gomal University and the newly
            established medical colleges attract students from across the
            country. DI Khan is also strategically important due to its location
            near South Waziristan and serves as a gateway to tribal areas. The
            people are known for their hospitality and simple lifestyle.
            Although it faces challenges like power shortages and lack of
            infrastructure, DI Khan continues to grow and evolve as an important
            part of the province.
