            Quetta is the capital city of Balochistan and is located near the
            Afghan border. Surrounded by mountains, it is known for its scenic
            beauty, cool climate, and fruit orchards, especially apples, grapes,
            and pomegranates. The city is strategically important and serves as
            a major trade and communication center. The population is diverse,
            consisting of Baloch, Pashtun, Hazara, and other communities.
            Quetta‚Äôs rich history includes influence from various civilizations
            like Greeks, Persians, and Mughals. It has important military and
            educational institutions, such as Command and Staff College and
            University of Balochistan. Quetta‚Äôs bazaars are famous for dry
            fruits, carpets, and handicrafts. The city has faced challenges due
            to terrorism and sectarian violence, but the people remain
            resilient. Development projects, including road and railway links,
            aim to boost the region‚Äôs connectivity. Quetta is also a gateway for
            trade with Afghanistan and Iran. Despite its issues, the city‚Äôs
            unique geography, culture, and determination of its people make
            Quetta a significant part of Pakistan‚Äôs identity.
