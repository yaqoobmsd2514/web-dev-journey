            Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan in terms of area but
            the least populated. It is located in the southwestern region of the
            country and shares borders with Iran and Afghanistan. The provincial
            capital is Quetta, a mountainous city known for its cool climate and
            fruit orchards. Balochistan is rich in natural resources, including
            gas, coal, copper, and gold. Despite its wealth in minerals, the
            province remains underdeveloped compared to other regions. The main
            languages spoken are Balochi, Pashto, Brahui, and Urdu. The people
            of Balochistan are known for their strong tribal traditions,
            bravery, and hospitality. The landscape consists of deserts, rugged
            mountains, and dry plains. One of the most famous locations in the
            province is the Chaghi mountains, where Pakistan conducted its
            nuclear tests in 1998. Balochistan also has a long coastline along
            the Arabian Sea, including the strategic port of Gwadar, which is
            being developed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
            Educational development, healthcare access, and economic
            opportunities remain key issues for the province. However,
            Balochistan's unique cultural identity, scenic beauty, and resource
            wealth make it a vital part of Pakistan's future.
