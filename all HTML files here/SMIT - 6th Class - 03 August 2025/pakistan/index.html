            Pakistan is a country located in South Asia, sharing borders with
            India, Afghanistan, Iran, and China. It also has a coastline along
            the Arabian Sea. With a population exceeding 240 million people, it
            is the fifth most populous country in the world. The country was
            formed in 1947 after gaining independence from British rule and was
            created as a homeland for Muslims from the Indian subcontinent.
            Pakistan has four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
            (KPK), and Balochistan, along with federal territories like
            Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan. The capital city is Islamabad, while
            Karachi is the largest and most economically significant city.
            Pakistan has a rich cultural heritage, diverse ethnic groups, and
            numerous languages spoken throughout the nation, with Urdu being the
            national language and English widely used for official purposes. The
            country has mountains, deserts, plains, and rivers. It is home to
            the world's second-highest peak, K2, and many ancient civilizations
            like the Indus Valley. Agriculture, textiles, sports goods, and
            information technology play key roles in its economy. Pakistanis are
            known for their hospitality, resilience, and strong family values.
            Despite challenges such as political instability and economic
            issues, Pakistan continues to strive for development and global
            recognition.
