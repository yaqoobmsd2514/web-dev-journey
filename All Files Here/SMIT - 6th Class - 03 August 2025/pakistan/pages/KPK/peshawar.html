            Peshawar is the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and one of
            the oldest cities in South Asia, with a history dating back over
            2,000 years. It is located near the border with Afghanistan and has
            historically served as a gateway to the Indian subcontinent. The
            city has seen the rise and fall of many civilizations, including the
            Greeks, Mughals, and British. Peshawar is predominantly inhabited by
            Pashtuns, and the Pashto language is widely spoken. It is famous for
            its unique culture, hospitality, cuisine, and traditional
            handicrafts. The Qissa Khwani Bazaar (Bazaar of Storytellers) is a
            historical market known for its rich history and vibrant atmosphere.
            Landmarks like Bala Hisar Fort, Peshawar Museum, and Islamia College
            reflect the cityâ€™s deep cultural roots. Peshawar also plays a major
            role in the education and healthcare sectors of KPK. Despite facing
            security challenges in the past, the city has made significant
            progress in urban development, public transport, and tourism. Its
            resilience, colorful traditions, and historical significance make
            Peshawar a central figure in the identity of KPK and Pakistan as a
            whole.
