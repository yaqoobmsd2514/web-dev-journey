            Punjab is the most populous province of Pakistan, located in the
            eastern part of the country. It is known as the heart of Pakistan
            because of its historical, cultural, and economic significance. The
            name "Punjab" means "Land of Five Rivers," referring to the rivers
            Ravi, Chenab, Sutlej, Jhelum, and Beas that once flowed through it.
            Lahore, the capital of Punjab, is considered the cultural capital of
            Pakistan and is known for its rich history, food, music, and
            architecture. Punjab plays a crucial role in the countryâ€™s
            agriculture, producing wheat, sugarcane, rice, and cotton. Its
            fertile lands and irrigation systems make it Pakistanâ€™s breadbasket.
            The province is home to diverse communities and languages, primarily
            Punjabi, Urdu, and English. Punjab has a strong tradition of Sufi
            poetry, folk music, and festivals like Basant and Eid. Educational
            institutions, such as the University of the Punjab and LUMS, attract
            students from all over Pakistan. Industrial cities like Faisalabad
            and Sialkot contribute significantly to Pakistanâ€™s economy. Punjab
            is also rich in historical sites, such as the Badshahi Mosque,
            Shalimar Gardens, and the ancient city of Harappa. Overall, Punjab
            represents a vibrant blend of tradition, culture, and progress.
