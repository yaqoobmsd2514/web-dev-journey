            Chaghi (or Chagai) is a district in the western part of Balochistan,
            Pakistan, and is one of the largest districts by area. It gained
            international fame when Pakistan conducted its first successful
            nuclear tests here on 28 May 1998 at the Ras Koh Hills. This
            historic event made Pakistan the first nuclear power in the Islamic
            world. Chaghi is located near the borders of Iran and Afghanistan
            and is known for its dry, desert-like terrain. The district has
            mineral wealth, including deposits of gold, copper, and marble. The
            Reko Diq area in Chaghi contains one of the world‚Äôs largest
            undeveloped gold and copper reserves. The local population consists
            mainly of Baloch tribes, and the main languages are Balochi and
            Brahui. Due to its remote location, the district faces issues like
            lack of clean water, healthcare, and education. However, it holds
            great strategic and economic importance for Pakistan. The mountains
            of Chaghi, particularly the Ras Koh range, have become symbols of
            national pride due to the nuclear tests. While underdeveloped,
            Chaghi‚Äôs rich resources and historical value make it a key area for
            future investment and development.
